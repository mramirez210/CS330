# CS330
The design skills that this project helped is creating shapes and learning how to manipulate c++ code to allow a scene to be created. The design proces for this project was looking at the picture and identify what shapes needed to be applied and implementing different portions of code to help with the shapes. I think the tactics from the work can be used for creating diagrams and visualizing the idea to create a picture. Furthermore, the development strategies that I used was looking at the requiremetns for the milestones and have that included into my project to help me process ideas to get things done. What led me to the completion of the project is learning to evolve and learn more C++ and OpenGL because I know what both were; I just did not know how to use them properly. The new knowledge from this class is giving me further educational prowess by allowing me to become more of a visual person and think more analytical.
